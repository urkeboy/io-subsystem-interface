# io-subsystem-interface
[Computer Architecture] CPU communication with I/O devices and DMA controllers in Assembly.

Homework/project in **Computer Architecture (13E112AR)** at the University of Belgrade, School of Electrical Engineering.

* 1. part (A3) - initializing IVT (Interrupt Vector Table) entries, and loading arrays A and B from two peripherals using interrupts.
* 2. part (B3) - processing elements using the dedicated subroutine and copying new array into operating memory using DMA (Direct memory access) controller in packet mode.
* 3. part (V0) - sending the resulting array to a peripheral by probing device status.
